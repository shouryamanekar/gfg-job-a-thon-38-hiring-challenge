Make Perfect Array

An array is called perfect if all its adjacent elements are distinct.
You are given a positive integer array arr of length n. You have to make it perfect by applying the below operation any number of times - 
in one operation you can select any index i (0<=i<=n) and replace arr[i] with any positive integer value.

You have to return minimum number of operations required to make array arr perfect.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3}
Output:
2
Explanation:
in first operation replace arr[1] (i.e. 2) with 4 and updated arr will be {1, 4, 2, 3, 3}.
in second operation replace arr[4] (i.e. 3) with 2 and updated arr will be {1, 4, 2, 3, 2} and now it is perfect.
So, minimum 2 operations are required to make arr perfect .
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output:
0
Explanation:
As array arr is already a perfect array so no operation is required.
Your Task:
You have to complete the function makePerfect( ) , which takes an integer n and a positive integer array arr of length n as input parameters and returns the minimum number of operations required to make arr perfect.

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 106
1 <= arr[i] <= 109
